## Biopharm Package Shared Software - Project Creation
The purpose of this document is to outline the important aspects of the projects that were created.  

You will find a folder for the Shiny app using the BioPharmSoft template which links to a R package for computation and utilizes modules to avoid the entire application residing in the server.r or ui.r files.  This was done to help with testing and validation.  

Each project consists of an R Studio project file with the extension .Rproj.  For each project, please open these files. Within each project there is a Instructions.Rmd file to provide specific details about that project. 

Before the Shiny app will run you must first build the R package or remove the reference in the Shiny app in the Golbal.R file.
